        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Hey <span class="name"></span>, looks like your language of choice is JavaScript! JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>

      <div id='Python'>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p><p>Hey there <span class="name"></span>! Not sure what to go with, or simply like snakes? Try Python! Python is a general-purpose coding languageâ€”which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.</p>

        <h3>Rust</h3>
        <p><p>Hey <span class="name"></span>, looks like your language of choice is Rust! With direct access to hardware and memory, Rust is an ideal language for embedded and bare-metal development. You can write extremely low-level code, such as operating system kernels or microcontroller applications.</p>
